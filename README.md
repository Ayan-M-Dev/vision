## Overview
AI-Enhanced Railway Safety and Crowd Management is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing the Indian Railways by leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to address critical challenges faced by the railway sector. Our project focuses on real-time anomaly detection, crowd management, and crime prevention using the existing CCTV network.

## Objective
Our objective is to enhance passenger safety, comfort, and the overall travel experience within the Indian Railways by deploying state-of-the-art AI models and real-time data analysis. We aim to address the following key challenges:
- Real-time anomaly detection for enhanced crowd management and crime prevention.
- Efficient monitoring of maintenance tasks to ensure railway infrastructure remains safe and reliable.
- Providing immediate guidance and assistance to passengers during security threats or other emergencies.

## Key Features
- **AI Models:** We fine-tune deep learning models using Vision Transformer (ViT) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) for real-time anomaly detection.
- **Web Application:** Our AI seamlessly integrates into a user-friendly web application for accessible results.
- **CCTV Network Integration:** Utilizing existing CCTV infrastructure for real-time monitoring and enhanced security.
- **Frame Storage and Preprocessing:** Implementation of a frame storage system for capturing and preprocessing CCTV images.
- **GPS-Based Guidance:** Providing real-time route guidance during emergencies for passenger safety.

## Technological Stack
Our project leverages a robust technological stack, including:
- Hugging Face
- HTML, CSS
- Python Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Google Maps Geolocation API
- GitHub
- OpenCV
